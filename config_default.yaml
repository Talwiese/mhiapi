#  - sampler: Samples analog values using parameters set in config. Opens unix domain sockets and writes data for displayer and publisher to read.
#  - displayer: Reponsible for user interactions on the mhia pi device. Controls display and reacts on buttons pushed on mhia pi.
#  - publisher: Publishes sensor data using MQTT. Paths to TLS certificates and the clients key for connection to a MQTT-broker are specified here.
#  - storer: Not implemented yet, will handel local storing of sensor data. Its planned to use a local Influx DB.

# adc_resolution can be 12, 14, 16 or 18 bits

# The negative quanitzation levels are neglected on the mhia pi hardware.
# The actual bit resolution is therefore one bit less.
adc_resolution: 12

# This list sets desired sampling intervalls in milliseconds for each possible resolution.
# The values 20, 50, 100, and 333 are tested smallest sampling intervalls for the MCP3424 chips, and deliver .
# Do not reduce these values! Higher values will most likely work without problems, lower values will probably result in unknown behaviour. 
requested_sampling_interval:
  12: 20    # 20 ms corresponds to 50 sps
  14: 50    # 50 ms corresponds to 25 sps

# adc_gain can be 1, 2, 4 or 8
# The programmable gain amplification (PGA) of the MCP3424 chips. For now both chips will have the same PGA set.
# Should be set in accordance with your sensor application's maximum output voltage and desired sensitivity.
# An adc_gain of 1 means that the actual current voltage difference between a channels pin and GND is beeing quantized.

# There are 8 sensor channels from 1 to 8 on the mhia pi board, 
# channels 1, 2, 3, 4 are converted on first chip,
# channels 5, 6, 7, 8 are converted on the second chip.
# The value should be the wanted channels as a list (e.g. [1,2] or [3,4,7,8] or ...)
active_channels: [8]

# Configuration of each channel as a dictionary.
# For each channel:
#  - description can be any string
#  - min_voltage and max_voltage are the possible sensor's output
#  - calc are parameters for live calculation of the qunatized values and contains a unit and coefficients
#  - consider a polynom in the form: a*x^1 + b*x^0 + c*x^(-1) = a*x + b + c/x (a, b and c correspond to '1', '0' and '-1' keys in this section)
#  - in other words: value of '0' acts as an offset, value of '1' the factor for direct proportionality and value of '-1' is the factor for indirect proportionality 
#  - In most situations you will normally have non-zero values for '0' and '1' or for '0' and '-1' but not for all three coefficients at the same time
